**Issue**: #12 Unify and Standardize Skill Management across .gemini and .roo

## Summary
Unified the skill management system by establishing `.gemini/skills/` as the primary source of truth for portable skills, while maintaining independent copies in `.roo/skills/`. This ensures a standardized format while respecting the repository independence of both tools.

## Changes
- Identified and consolidated portable skills into `.gemini/skills/` with consistent `skill-` prefixing.
- Replaced previous `.roo/skills/` contents with standardized versions from `.gemini/skills/`.
- Ensured no symlinks are used; content is physically copied to maintain repository independence.
- Exposed Gemini-original skills (`skill-state-manager`, etc.) to Roo by copying them.
- Updated `skill-orchestration` to use correct internal paths.
- Created a new standard `skill-template.md` with YAML frontmatter for metadata.
- Standardized `SKILL.md` format across all skills.

## Verification
- Verified that `skill-state-manager` still functions correctly.
- Verified that `.roo/skills/` contains actual directories and files, not symlinks.
- Verified that `skill-orchestration` script paths are updated.

## Conclusion
The skill system is now standardized. While duplication exists to support independent repositories, the structure and format are consistent, facilitating manual or automated synchronization in the future.
