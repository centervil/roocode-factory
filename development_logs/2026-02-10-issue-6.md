**Issue**: #6 Dogfooding: Refactor a Skill

## Summary
Started Issue #6 to validate the IDD workflow and refactor the `State Management Skill`. The goal is to make the state update process more dynamic and robust, moving away from the initial hardcoded PoC implementation.

## Progress
- Initialized issue workspace in `docs/issues/6/`.
- Defined requirements, design, and task list.
- Refactored `update-state.sh` to be dynamic:
    - Automatically fetches Issue Title from GitHub CLI or local `requirements.md`.
    - Updates `project_state.md` based on matching title.
    - Supports marking specific tasks using `<!-- id: X -->` markers.
- Updated `SKILL.md` with usage instructions.
- Successfully verified the new logic by using it to manage this issue's tasks.

## Conclusion
The refactoring successfully transitioned `skill-state-manager` from a hardcoded PoC to a reusable, dynamic tool. This also served as a successful dogfooding exercise for the IDD workflow.
